## Technologies Used

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/): Used for developing the user interface, Flutter provides a flexible and intuitive framework for creating visually appealing applications.
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/): As the primary programming language, Dart powers the logic and functionality of the **Rate Me!** application.
- [iTunes API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/): Utilized to search for albums and retrieve detailed album data, the iTunes API serves as the primary data source for the application.
- **JSON Parser for Bandcamp**: A JSON parser is used to search and retrieve detailed album data from Bandcamp links.
